# Put a copy of this cmake file into the top level folder of an "experimental" project.
# The project will be added to the solution. You automatically get the option to exclude it from the solution via the cmake GUI.
# Also the library-names will be combined with the project name, to make them unique (and thus not collide with any other projects).
