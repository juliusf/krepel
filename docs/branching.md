In general, we are creating branches in the style of the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

The rules are rather simple:

- If you're working on a bug fix or some very small feature that only spans a single commit, you may directly work on the `master` branch.
- If you're working on something *bigger*, create a branch with some descriptive name. The name does not need to follow some specific pattern or anything, it should just have a name where everyone can at least guess what's going on there.

It should also be made sure that the `master` branch is always in decent condition.
