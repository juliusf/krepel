Game Design Ideas
=================

*NOTE: Game design ideas should go in the [general repo](/lab132/lab132). We will probably move the ideas below there at some point.*

Generally wanted
================

- 2D
- Multiplayer
- Content Generation


Shapeshifter (preferred)
------------------------

- Change into objects/beings to trick/avoid/fight enemies or solve puzzles
  - e.g. Change into a vase inside a house to avoid being seen.
  - but: your transformation is not perfect, you have to learn to master it.
    - e.g. vase with glasses/mustache/bunny ears -> low disguise level in the beginning.
    - e.g. frog can only jump once in the air, later more often
    - plenty of easter eggs possible (e.g. cardboard box from "metal gear solid" series)
- Auto generated monsters/enemies
  - generated out of a set of body parts (head, arms (2, 4, 6), legs, tail, body, ...)
    - see "pokemon fusion"
  - animation???
- few or no attacks(?) -> stealth?
  - try to avoid attacks if possible
- (local) Co-op: help each other through the level
  - e.g. player1 transforms into baseball bat, player2 uses him to fight off enemies
  - e.g. player1 transforms into fan, player2 transforms into paper plane, ...
  - e.g. player1 transforms into vase, player2 into flowers, to achieve better disguise values
  - => would need gamepad support.
- AI of monsters/enemies would be trivial -> attack on sight, react to louder sounds -> no actual cognitive AI
- possible story:
  - sorcerer (student) learns basics of transformation from his master (tutorial: you play the master), then needs to do stuff on his own (Coop: with other student(s))
  - e.g. saving the master, saving, the princess, saving the world... whatever.
- possible setting:
  - medieval, modern elements
  - funny, humorous, not serious
    - see "Magicka"

- Inspiration:
  - Magicka (setting, story, humor)
  - Mark of the Ninja (stealth, confusion-spells ?)
  - Rogue Legacy (setting, humor, jump-n-run, enemies, ...)

Strategy Space Shooter
----------------------

- Auto generated space (Planets, Asteroids,...)
- Choose a battlefield (set marks on a map), place spaceships, fight as one of them.
  - e.g. in an asteroids belt enemies can't find you that easily, but you have to avoid collisions.

- Gain resources/money from enemies to buy new ships/weapons/upgrades/...
- Multiplayer (versus) -> LAN
  - evtl. singelplayer, but a "humanlike" AI is needed here (strategy, planing, ...)

unfinished:
- Gamedesign skript (is halt leider deutsch)
- from Wohlbrecht for "Praxis der Spieleentwicklung"
